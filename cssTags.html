                        <td>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

                            We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
                            
                            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
                            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
                            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
                            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
                            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>align</td>

                        <td>Combinators</td>
                        <td>Combinators are used when selecting based on descendant or adjacency There are four different combinators in CSS:

                            descendant selector (space)
                            child selector (>)
                            adjacent sibling selector (+)
                            general sibling selector (~)

                    <tr>
                        <td>transitions</td>
                        <td>To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

                            the CSS property you want to add an effect to
                            the duration of the effect
                            Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
                            
                            The following example shows a 100px * 100px red "div" element. The "div" element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:</td>

                        <td>gradient</td>
                        <td>To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

                            background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);</td>

                        <td>The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

                            The float property can have one of the following values:
                            
                            left - The element floats to the left of its container
                            right - The element floats to the right of its container
                            none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
                            inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
                            In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</td>
